         You need to sort an array of integers by repeatedly reversing
         the order of the first several elements of it.

         For example, to sort [12,13,11,14], you need to  reverse the order of the first two (2)
         elements and get [13,12,11,14] and then reverse the order of the first three (3)
         elements and get [11,12,13,14]

         The method should return the shortest(!) possible list of integers corresponding to 
         the required reversals.
         For the previous example, given an array [12,13,11,14]
         the method should return a list with Integers 2 and 3.
