 *         Problem Statement      
 *         
 *         A kingdom has n citizens. Each one has some
 *         amount of money, a number of dollars denoted by a non-negative
 *         integer. Citizens are numbered from 0 to n-1. Some citizens have
 *         friends. Their friendship network is described by a String[] called
 *         isFriend, such that if isFriend[i][j] == 'Y', the citizens numbered i
 *         and j are friends, and if isFriend[i][j] == 'N', these citizens are
 *         not friends. The king decrees the following: Each citizen's amount of
 *         money must be within d dollars of the amount of money belonging to
 *         any of his friends. In other words, a citizen with x dollars must not
 *         have any friends with less than x-d dollars or more than x+d dollars.
 *         Given the number of citizens and their friendship network, what is
 *         the greatest possible money difference between any two people (not
 *         necessarily friends) in this kingdom? If there is a finite answer,
 *         return it. Otherwise, return -1. Definition      
 *         
 *         Class:
 *         Egalitarianism 
 *         
 *         Method: maxDifference 
 *         Parameters: String[], int
 *         Returns: int 
 *         Method signature: int maxDifference(String[] isFriend,
 *         int d) 
 *         
 *         (be sure your method is public)     
 * 
 *         Constraints - n will be between 2 and 50, inclusive. 
 *         - d will be between 0 and 1,000, inclusive. 
 *         - isFriend will contain exactly n elements. 
 *         - Each element of isFriend will contain exactly n characters, 
 *         each of which is either 'Y' or 'N'. 
 *         - For any i, isFriend[i][i] = 'N'. 
 *         - For any i and j, isFriend[i][j] = isFriend[j][i]. 
 *         
 *         Examples 0)
 * 
 *              {"NYN", "YNY", "NYN"} 10 Returns: 20 The kingdom has three
 *         citizens. Citizens 0 and 1 are friends. Also, citizens 1 and 2 are
 *         friends. The greatest possible money difference between any two
 *         citizens is $20, as in the following configuration: citizen 0 has
 *         $100; citizen 1 has $110; citizen 2 has $120. 1)
 * 
 *              {"NN", "NN"} 1 Returns: -1 Since citizens 0 and 1 are not
 *         friends, there are no constraints between them. 2)
 * 
 *              {"NNYNNN", "NNYNNN", "YYNYNN", "NNYNYY", "NNNYNN", "NNNYNN"}
 *         1000 Returns: 3000
 * 
 *         3)
 * 
 *              {"NNYN", "NNNY", "YNNN", "NYNN"} 584 Returns: -1
 * 
 *         4)
 * 
 *              {"NYNYYYN", "YNNYYYN", "NNNNYNN", "YYNNYYN", "YYYYNNN",
 *         "YYNYNNY", "NNNNNYN"} 5 Returns: 20
 * 
 *         5)
 * 
 *              {"NYYNNNNYYYYNNNN", "YNNNYNNNNNNYYNN", "YNNYNYNNNNYNNNN",
 *         "NNYNNYNNNNNNNNN", "NYNNNNYNNYNNNNN", "NNYYNNYNNYNNNYN",
