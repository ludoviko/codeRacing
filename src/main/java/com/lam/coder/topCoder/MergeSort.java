 *         Problem Statement MergeSort is a classical sorting algorithm
 *         following the divide-and-conquer paradigm. Sorting n elements, it has
 *         a worst-case complexity of O(n*log(n)), which is optimal for sorting
 *         algorithms based on comparisons.
 * 
 *         Basically, it sorts a list with more than one element the following
 *         way (a list containing only one element is always sorted):
 * 
 *         1. divide the list into two sublists of about equal size (divide) 2.
 *         sort each of the two sublists (conquer) 3. merge the two sorted
 *         sublists into one sorted list (combine)
 * 
 *         A pro of MergeSort is that it is stable, i.e. elements with the same
 *         key value keep their relative order during sorting. A con is that it
 *         is not in-place since it needs additional space for temporarily
 *         storing elements.
 * 
 *         Given a int[] numbers, return the number of comparisons the MergeSort
 *         algorithm (as described in pseudocode below) makes in order to sort
 *         that list. In this context, a single comparison takes two numbers x,
 *         y (from the list to be sorted) and determines which of x < y, x = y
 *         and x > y holds.
 * 
 *         List mergeSort(List a)
 * 
 *         1. if size(a) <= 1, return a
 * 
 *         2. split a into two sublists b and c
 * 
 *         if size(a) = 2*k, b contains the first k elements of a, c the last k
 *         elements
 * 
 *         if size(a) = 2*k+1, b contains the first k elements of a, c the last
 *         k+1 elements
 * 
 *         3. List sb = mergeSort(b)
 * 
 *         List sc = mergeSort(c)
 * 
 *         4. return merge(sb, sc)
 * 
 * 
 *         List merge(List b, List c)
 * 
 *         1. create an empty list a
 * 
 *         2. while both b and c are not empty, compare the first elements of b
 *         and c
 * 
 *         first(b) < first(c): remove the first element of b and append it to
 *         the end of a
 * 
 *         first(b) > first(c): remove the first element of c and append it to
 *         the end of a
 * 
 *         first(b) = first(c): remove the first elements of b and c and append
 *         them to the end of a
 * 
 *         3. if either b or c is not empty, append that non-empty list to the
 *         end of a
 * 
 *         4. return a

 *         Class: MergeSort Method: howManyComparisons Parameters: int[]
 *         Returns: int Method signature: int howManyComparisons(int[] numbers)

 * 
 *         Notes - Be sure to exactly follow the algorithm as described, as a
 *         different implementation of MergeSort might lead to a different
 *         number of comparisons.
 * 
 *         Constraints - numbers contains between 0 and 50 elements, inclusive.
 *         - Each element of numbers is an int in its 'natural' (signed 32-bit)
 *         range from -(2^31) to (2^31)-1.

 * 
 *         Returns: 4
 * 
 *         {1, 2, 3, 4} is first split to {1, 2} and {3, 4}. {1, 2} is split to
 *         {1} and {2} and merging to {1, 2} takes one comparison. {3, 4} is
 *         split to {3} and {4} and merging to {3, 4} also takes one comparison.
 *         Merging {1, 2} and {3, 4} to {1, 2, 3, 4} takes two comparisons
 *         (first 1 is compared to 3 and then 2 is compared to 3). This makes a
 *         total of four comparisons. 1)

 *         to {2, 3} making one comparison. {2} and {2, 3} are merged to {2, 2,
 *         3} also making one comparison, which totals to two comparisons made.
