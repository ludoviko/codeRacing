 *         Problem Statement for PrimalUnlicensedCreatures
 * 
 *         Problem Statement The Primal Grez are ferocious creatures. They
 *         constantly fight each other. When a Grez wins a battle against
 *         another Grez, the winner captures the loser's essence, thus becoming
 *         stronger. More formally: The power level of each Grez is a positive
 *         integer. A Grez can only defeat creatures that have a strictly
 *         smaller power level. When a Grez of power level X defeats a Grez of
 *         power level Y, the first Grez's power level is increased to X + Y/2.
 *         Note that Y/2 represents integer division, i.e., the fractional part
 *         is discarded. For example, for Y=3 we have Y/2 = 1. Your goal is to
 *         help a Grez that currently has power level equal to int initialLevel
 *         battle against a set of other Grez. For each i, Grez number i
 *         (0-based index) has a power level equal to grezPower[i]. Your Grez
 *         can challenge the other creatures in any order.
 * 
 *         You are given the int initialLevel and the int[] grezPower. Return
 *         the maximum number of creatures your Grez can defeat, one after
 *         another.

 *         Definition
 * 
 *         Class: PrimalUnlicensedCreatures Method: maxWins Parameters: int,
 *         int[] Returns: int Method signature: int maxWins(int initialLevel,
 *         int[] grezPower) (be sure your method is public)
 * 
 * 
 *         Constraints - initialLevel will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive. -
 *         grezPower will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive. - Each
 *         element of grezPower will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
 * 
 *         Examples 0)
 * 
 *         31 {10, 20, 30} Returns: 3 It is possible to defeat all the available
 *         opponents. For example: Defeat the creature with power level 30. Your
 *         creature's power level becomes 31 + 15 = 46. Defeat the creature with
 *         power level 10. Your creature's power level becomes 46 + 5 = 51.
 *         Defeat the creature with power level 20. Your creature's power level
 *         becomes 51 + 10 = 61. 1)
 * 
 *         20 {24, 5, 6, 38} Returns: 3 It is best to defeat creatures 1 and 2
 *         before facing creature 0. Your creature's power level will be 25 when
 *         facing creature 0. It is not possible to defeat creature 3. 2)
 * 
 *         20 {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 25 } Returns: 6 It is possible to defeat the 6
 *         weakest creatures. After that your creature's power level will be 25,
 *         which is not strong enough to defeat another level 25 creature. 3)
 * 
 *         4 {3, 13, 6, 4, 9} Returns: 5 4)
 * 
 *         7 {7, 8, 9, 10} Returns: 0 All the available opponents are too strong
 *         for your creature to defeat. This problem statement is the exclusive
